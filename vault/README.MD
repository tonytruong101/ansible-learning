## Technical Overview

Ansible Vault is a feature that allows you to store sensitive data, such as passwords or secrets, in encrypted files. Vault uses AES encryption to protect the data, and it can be used to secure sensitive data in your playbooks and prevent it from being checked into version control.

To use Ansible Vault, you first need to create an encrypted file using the ansible-vault command line tool. You can do this using the create or edit subcommands:

```
ansible-vault create secrets.yml
```

This will create a new encrypted file called secrets.yml and open it in an editor, where you can enter the sensitive data you want to store. When you're finished, you can save the file and close the editor. The file will be encrypted and saved to disk.

To use the sensitive data in a playbook, you can use the include_vars module and specify the path to the encrypted file:

```
- name: Load secrets
  include_vars:
    file: secrets.yml
    vault_password_file: vault_password.txt
```

The vault_password_file argument specifies the path to a file containing the Vault password, which is used to decrypt the encrypted file.

It's important to note that the Vault password must be kept secure, as anyone with access to the password can decrypt the encrypted files. You can use tools such as Ansible Tower or Hashicorp Vault to manage Vault passwords and provide secure access to sensitive data.


**Here are some advanced concepts for Ansible Vault**

**Vault IDs**: Ansible Vault supports the use of "Vault IDs", which allow you to create multiple encrypted files with different passwords within the same playbook. This can be useful for separating sensitive data by environment or by role, or for allowing different users to manage different pieces of sensitive data.

**Vault password file**: As mentioned earlier, the vault_password_file argument specifies the path to a file containing the Vault password. This file can be used to provide the password to ansible-playbook without exposing it on the command line or in environment variables.

**Vault password prompt**: If you do not specify a vault_password_file, ansible-playbook will prompt you for the Vault password. This can be useful if you do not want to store the password in a file, but it may not be suitable for automated deployments.

**Vault encryption options**: Ansible Vault supports different encryption options, such as AES-256 and blowfish, which can be specified using the --encrypt-vault-id option. You can also use your own GPG key to encrypt the data instead of a password.

**Vault in playbooks and roles**: Ansible Vault can be used in playbooks and roles to encrypt sensitive data that is used by those playbooks and roles. This can be useful for protecting sensitive data that is specific to a particular playbook or role, or for separating sensitive data from the rest of the playbook or role.
