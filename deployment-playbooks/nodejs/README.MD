## Playbook Overview

This playbook adds the Node.js repository to the target systems, and then installs the nodejs package. The nodejs package includes the Node.js runtime and the npm package manager.

To use this playbook, you will need to make sure that the target systems have the apt package manager installed and configured, and that the playbook has the necessary permissions to install the packages.
