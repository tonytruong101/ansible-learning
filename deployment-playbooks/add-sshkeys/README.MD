## Playbook Overview

This playbook adds the specified SSH key to the authorized_keys file of the user username on the target systems. The key is specified as a string in the key field of the playbook.

To use this playbook, you will need to replace the username and the key with the actual values that you want to use. You can generate an SSH key using the ssh-keygen command-line utility, and then copy the public key and use it in the playbook.

For example, to generate an SSH key and copy the public key, you can use the following commands:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
The first command generates an SSH key with the RSA algorithm and a 4096-bit key size, and stores it in the ~/.ssh/ directory. The second command prints the public key of the generated key to the console. You can then copy the key and use it in the playbook.
