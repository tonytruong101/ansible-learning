## Technical Overview

Ansible roles are a way to organize and share playbooks and associated files. 

**Here are some advanced features of ansible roles**:

**Reusability**: Ansible roles are designed to be reusable, allowing you to share and use the same role in multiple playbooks. This can help you avoid duplication and make your automation more maintainable.

**Structure**: Ansible roles have a standardized file and directory structure, which makes it easy to understand and use roles created by others. The standard structure includes directories for tasks, files, templates, and variables, as well as optional directories for handlers and other types of content.

**Dependencies**: Ansible roles can specify dependencies on other roles, allowing you to build complex automation pipelines using a series of interconnected roles.

**Overriding variables**: Ansible roles allow you to override variables defined in the role using variables defined in the playbook or in external variable files. This can be useful for customizing the behavior of a role for specific deployments.

**Tags**: Ansible roles can include tags, which allow you to group tasks or other content within the role. You can then use tags to selectively execute specific tasks or groups of tasks when running a playbook.
