## Technical Overview

Ansible modules are small, standalone scripts that can be used to perform a specific task, such as installing a package, copying a file, or starting a service. 

**Here are some advanced features of ansible modules**:

**Arguments**: Most ansible modules accept arguments to customize their behavior. For example, the copy module accepts arguments such as src and dest to specify the source and destination files.

**Return values**: Ansible modules return a JSON dictionary containing the result of the task. This dictionary can include information about the task's success or failure, as well as any output or data generated by the task.

**Custom modules**: You can create custom ansible modules by writing scripts in a language such as Python or Bash. This can be useful if you need to perform a task that is not supported by the built-in ansible modules.

**Fact gathering**: Ansible includes a number of modules specifically designed for gathering information about your hosts, known as "facts". These modules can be used to gather information such as the host's operating system, IP address, or installed packages.

**Idempotence**: Ansible modules are designed to be idempotent, meaning that running the same module multiple times with the same arguments should have the same effect as running it once. This can be useful for tasks that may be run multiple times, such as during a rolling deployment.
